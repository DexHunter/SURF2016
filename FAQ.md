## SURF Project: Online Forex Portfolio Selection with MetaTrader4(changed to oanda)

* What are we going to do in this project?
  * You are going to make money by buying and selling forex(foreign exchange market).
  * Actually, you aren't doing that by hand. Instead, you are going to write a programme automatically doing it for you.

* How long will the project last?
  * The official range of the project is from 26 June to 1 September 2017.
  
* What is forex?
  * The foreign exchange maket is the "place" where currencies are traded

* Where are we going to buy and sell these virtual money's?
  * On a US based forex exchange called OANDA.

* Why Onada?
  * python support
  * etc

* Connection to oanda is slow. How can we handle frequent trading requests from my computer?
  * We are going to use a virtual linux computer on Amazon Web Services (AWS) to run our auto-trading programme.(possible)

* Do I have to be an expert in programming to do this project?
  * No. You can learn coding along the way. However, if you have some programming experience, that would helps very much.

* What programming language are we going to use?
  * Preferably Python, since it is the most popular one in both financial computing and machine learning. However, if you have a very strong attachment to a particular language other than Python, you can use that instead, provided you can persuade your teammates to stick with your choice.

* What methods are we going to use to predict the prices of the forex?
  * We are not going to predict the prices (that was what we did in the SURF project last year 2016). Instead, we want to decide when, what, and how much we are are going to buy or sell to guarantee the maximum profit. This is the so-called portfolio management or portfolio choice problem.

* Then what methods are we going to use to make these decisions?
  * It is up to you and your teammates, but I will provide a list of methods for you to pick up. 
  * However, preferably, I would like you to try out some modern deep learning methods, like Convolutional Neural Network and Recurrent Neural Network.

* Do I have to be familiar with finance to do the project?
  * No. As mentioned in the item above, our methods are mainly from Machine Learning, and it is more to do with Mathematics and Computer Algorithm than Finance. However, financial knowledge does help you understanding the problem setting better, and may provide addition insight to our methods.

* Machine Learning seems to be a difficult topic. Do I have to learn something about it before I do the project?
  * As well as for programming, you can learn Machine Learning by doing the project. However, if you want to prepare yourself better before the start of the project, you can have a look at this free ebook: http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/
  * We are going to use a Python library call TensorFlow. It make Machine Learning easier. They have some tutorials to start with: https://www.tensorflow.org/
